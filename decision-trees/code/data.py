    Associated test case: tests/test_data.py

    Reading and manipulating data is a vital skill for machine learning.

    This function loads the data in data_path csv into two numpy arrays:
    features (of size NxK) and targets (of size Nx1) where N is the number of rows
    and K is the number of features. 
    
    data_path leads to a csv comma-delimited file with each row corresponding to a 
    different example. Each row contains binary features for each example 
    (e.g. chocolate, fruity, caramel, etc.) The last column indicates the label for the
    example how likely it is to win a head-to-head matchup with another candy 
    bar.

    This function reads in the csv file, and reads each row into two numpy arrays.
    The first array contains the features for each row. For example, in candy-data.csv
    the features are:

    chocolate,fruity,caramel,peanutyalmondy,nougat,crispedricewafer,hard,bar,pluribus

    The second array contains the targets for each row. The targets are in the last 
    column of the csv file (labeled 'class'). The first row of the csv file contains 
    the labels for each column and shouldn't be read into an array.

    Example:
    chocolate,fruity,caramel,peanutyalmondy,nougat,crispedricewafer,hard,bar,pluribus,class
    1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

    should be turned into:

    [1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0] (features) and [1] (targets).

    This should be done for each row in the csv file, making arrays of size NxK and Nx1.

    Args:
        data_path (str): path to csv file containing the data

    Output:
        features (np.array): numpy array of size NxK containing the K features
        targets (np.array): numpy array of size Nx1 containing the 1 feature.
        attribute_names (list): list of strings containing names of each attribute 
            (headers of csv)
